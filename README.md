## Future Dev Notes
    # Later on we want to have named users which we instantiate once and maintain their own memory over time of what they say and the response they get.
    # That way we can do crazy things like have many "actors" speaking to any number of ChatGPT workers, something like that, they can persist.
    # bob = User(name="Bob")
    # bob.say("Help me translate the following corporate jargon into plain English.")
    # -OR-
    # chat.say(bob, "This late pivot means we don't have time to boil the ocean for the client deliverable.")
